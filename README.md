hello-world
===========

Just running through the tutorial.

Started some really basic programming back in about 2010 as part of my HSC where I created a crappy zombie shooter game using Scratch.
This year (2014) I started studying Video Games Development at SAE/QANTM where I've been learning C++ and C# and applying those language skills to Unity and Unreal Engine 4.
